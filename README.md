# Drum Machine

## Overview

This minimalistic drum machine is designed with a 3x3 grid of drum pads, allowing users to trigger sounds with both mouse clicks and keyboard presses. The project is part of my entries to the FreeCodeCamp Frontend Development Libraries Certification and aims to provide a simplified approach, functionally similar to the [Drum Machine example](https://drum-machine.freecodecamp.rocks/).

### Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** React
- **Styling:** Bootstrap (extended with SASS)

### UI Style

- Glassmorphism

## Features

- **3x3 Grid of Drum Pads:** A grid of nine drum pads, each representing a unique sound.
- **Keyboard Trigger:** Users can trigger the drum pads using keyboard keys, providing a tactile and interactive experience.
- **Active Key Display:** The "Display" component displays the currently active key or drum pad, allowing users to see which sound is being played.
- **Idle State:** When no keys or pads are active, the "Display" component displays and idle state.
